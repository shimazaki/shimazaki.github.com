We introduce a discrete multiplicative process as a generic model of
competition. Players with different abilities successively join the
game and compete for finite resources.  Emergence of dominant players
and evolutionary development occur as a phase transition. The competitive dynamics underlying this transition is understood from a formal analogy to statistical mechanics.
The theory is applicable to bacterial competition, predicting novel population dynamics near
criticality.

Competition occurs when two or more players such as organisms,
individuals or companies strive for common but limited resources. It
plays a significant role in biological and social activities, and is
the basis of evolution.
Most natural competition processes allow the
introduction of new players, which is a hallmark of an open,
nonequilibrium system.
In this contribution, we introduce an irreversible discrete multiplicative process with
normalization at each time step as a generic model of competition. Players with different abilities successively join the
game and compete for finite resources.  The model shows
macroscopically observable changes in its behavior; at a singularity
in the statistical distribution of the players' abilities, certain
players become dominant over all others.
The emergence of dominant
players and the evolutionary development of the system occur as a
transition from stationary to nonstationary state of the
multiplicative process.  We analyze the phase
transition in the mathematical framework of Bose-Einstein condensation
(BEC), although, of course, systems modelled are classical
and not quantum mechanical. The same approach has been applied
successfully to models of complex networks [#Bianconi01#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#] and
ecosystems [#Volkov04#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#] that behave
analogously to a Bose gas. We show that this approach is applicable to
bacterial competition, providing surprising insights and
predictions to their dynamics.

<P>
Before we present the model, we first introduce a general framework
for how our multiplicative competition model is related to a
statistical mechanics concept.

The competition we introduce is defined by three conditions at each time
step.
(i) Players compete for a fixed total amount of resources.
(ii) The resource gained by a player is proportional to the player's innate
ability and to its resource gained at the previous time step.
(iii) New players join the game, each with the same initial resources. The
only exception is the first player (pioneer), who starts the game with all
the resources available.
These rules are summarized in a simple multiplicative process,

<P>
We verified the existence of a BEC analogue in a discrete
multiplicative process, as was shown in a continuous model
[#Bianconi01#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. However, we emphasize that, as a matter of
principle, our classical dynamical system is not equivalent to a
quantum gas. The most important difference is based on the following
observation. The time evolution of each player's gain
is different above and below the predicted <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline533#. Above <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline535#, the
gains of all players monotonically decrease.
Below <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline537#, not all of them show monotonic behavior, and the
competitive dynamics is disordered.  The
observed nonequilibrium phase transition from ordered to disordered
state occurs as a violation of the stationarity in weighted mean
ability, <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline539#.  It is stationary if the
gain of all players monotonically decreases to zero, which allows the
argument below Eq.~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#38#301><tex2html_cr_mark></A>. Otherwise, if the gain of one player rises
to dominate the resources, the weighted mean ability approaches the
ability of this one dominant player.  Then due to the replacement of
the dominant player upon the entrance of a player with higher ability,
we observe an irreversible increase of the weighted mean ability,
indicating that the system is now <I>evolving</I>. Thus dominance
and evolution are aspects of nonstationary dynamics. We emphasize that
the phase transition yielding evolution does not happen in
equilibrium systems.

<P>
We now consider application of the theory to competition of clonal strains of asexual
<I>Escherichia coli</I> serially propagated on glucose-limited medium. The population dynamics is most suitably described by a stochastic branching process with
mutation and selection. Consider the <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline541#th strain with
fitness <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline543#, mutation rate <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline545#, and population size
<tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline547#.
Let <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline549# (<tex2html_verbatim_mark>#math84#<tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline551#) be given by
a Poisson distribution with mean
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>#math85#<tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline553#
Here <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline555# is the number of mutants that were
generated and that survived the initial step since the process
started.
The number of mutants produced at time <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline557#, <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline559#, is drawn from a
Poisson distribution with mean
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>#math86#<tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline561#.
Note that the average total number of cells at time <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline563# is fixed to
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>#math87#<tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline565# due to the normalization
factor in the above equations.

<P>
It is clear that our process Eq.~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#1#302><tex2html_cr_mark></A> is a deterministic approximation
of this stochastic population dynamics. A monotonically decreasing
fitness distribution <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline567# should be used because most mutations
are likely to be deleterious [#Fisher58#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].  We thus decided to use
the same <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline569# used in the analysis of the deterministic model (and
the state density Eq.~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#39#303><tex2html_cr_mark></A>) because it satisfies this basic tenet.  Our
results do not depend, however, on the precise form of the state
density; other parameterizations of the fitness distribution of
<tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline571# such as the beta distribution defined on <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline573#
yield essentially the same results (not shown).

<P>
<I>Routes to Adaptive Evolution:</I>
A strong prediction of the theory is the existence of a singular point
on the emergence of evolution. We observed the transition from
stationary to non-stationary state in the numerical simulation of the
stochastic process by decreasing the temperature <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline575#. The
transition point is predictable from the critical temperature <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline577#
obtained by the deterministic theory (Eq.~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#32#304><tex2html_cr_mark></A>). Above <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline579#, dominance
by a capable player (strain) appears. Below <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline581#, the dynamics are
governed by the random drift of dominant strains. The random fluctuation of dominant
strains is the most striking difference from dynamics of the deterministic model.

<P>
Another route to generate an
evolutionary development is to increase <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline583# by fixing <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline585#.  The
critical temperature given by Eq.~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#32#305><tex2html_cr_mark></A> is proportional to <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline587#, which is related to
mutation rate through <tex2html_verbatim_mark>#math88#<tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline589#.
We thus obtain

<I>Approach to the Transition Point by Natural Selection:</I>
An important question is wether <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline619# is comparable to
<tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline621# under natural conditions.
Evolutionary progress observed in laboratory
experiments of <I>E. coli</I> competition shows alteration of
long periods of relative stasis with short bursts of rapid change caused by
rare beneficial mutations [#Elena96#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].
Therefore, empirically observed
dynamics is consistent with model behavior at <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline623# in our construct at least during early stages of competition.
However, we argue that there exists a biologically plausible scenario in which
<tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline625# may eventually become comparable to <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline627# by internally tuning
the parameter [#Bak87#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#Kauffman91#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Instead of using a common fitness distribution for all strains, it
is physiologically plausible to assume that each strain has its
unique fitness distribution. We assume that fitness of mutants originating
from the <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline629#th strain of fitness <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline631# is drawn from a fitness distribution
characterized by the temperature <tex2html_verbatim_mark>#math92#<tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline633#.
Since most mutants are deleterious, the average fitness
produced with <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline635# should be less than <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline637# (i.e. <tex2html_verbatim_mark>#math93#<tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline639#, where <tex2html_verbatim_mark>#math94#<tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline641# for the state density

<P>
At the beginning of adaptive evolution, strains with higher fitness are
chosen by natural selection. Dominance by strains with high fitness
increases the average temperature of the population. Suppose that
adaptive evolution achieves a neutral condition, <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline649#. It is then by
chance wether or not a certain strain is picked up. Since a dominant
strain is prone to produce mutants inferior to the dominant strain
itself, those deleterious strains are likely to be picked up, and the
average temperature decreases.
There are ever going cycles of adaptive evolution, neutral state then collapse of the dominance (FIG.~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#SOC#312><tex2html_cr_mark></A>).
The advantage of the dynamics that approaches
criticality is rather clear. It allows initial adaptive evolution,
permanently eliminating unfavorable genotypes, but then significantly
slowing down or preventing further evolution
and dominance: close to the  critical state,
strains can co-exist for a substantial period of time.
Diversity introduced by the dynamics near criticality is clearly advantageous for the whole
ecosystem, which is exposed to global environmental changes. We thus conjecture that this strategy might be taken by some haploid species.
