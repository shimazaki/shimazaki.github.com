      <p align="left">In 18th century, Thomas Malthus argued that &quot;<i>Population, 
        when unchecked, increases in a geometrical ratio. Subsistence only increases 
        in an arithmetical ratio.</i>&quot; The statement is now known as Malthusian 
        population model. According to this hypthesis, the check is inevitable. 
        At the beginning of the last centruy, the logistic hypothesis, that assumes 
        nonlinear saturation factor for the exponential growth, has been extensively 
        investigated. These include the Lotka-Volttera equation of competition 
        and that of predaytor and prey. The former was confirmed by the laboratory 
        experiments of Paramecium conducted by G. F. Gauze. Incidentally, it was 
        pointed out by Robert May that its discrete one-dimensional model (the 
        logistic map), a model for insect population dynamics, shows chaotic behaviour. 
        The equation has provided theoretical grounds for the chaos in the dynamical 
        systems. However, if more than two species are involved in the differential 
        equations, no analytical solution is avalble. Furthermore, natural competitions 
        include many species, and allows the successive intruduction of new species, 
        which is an whole mark of <i>nonequilibrium system</i>. </p>
      <p align="left">We developed a theory in which we can treat natural competition 
        as a many-body problem, thus by statistical mechanics. Most importantly, 
        the model is based on the Malthusian population model. In this model, 
        instead of the logistic hypothesis, we introduce normalizatoin processes. 
        Every time step the population that grows exponentially normalizes to 
        a finte number. It is a game process in which players compete for <i>gains 
        </i>(money, food, market share...). The rules are very simple.</p>
      <p align="left">At each time step:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b> A players' gain is proportional to its ability and its gain at 
          the previous step. </b></li>
        <li><b> A new player joins the competition. </b></li>
        <li><b> Players compete for a fixed total amount of resources.</b><br>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p align="left">The analogy implies that gains obey unique characteristics 
        of <b>Bose statistics</b>; gains (money, food, market share...) have statistical 
        tendency to gather. As expected, the system shows phase transition analogous 
        to <b>Bose-Einstein condensation</b>, which draws natural analogy of dominance 
        and evolution as condensates in the process. Further analysis revealed 
        that this competitive process contains substantial features which were 
        already observed in the research of biological evolution. These are <i><b>competitive 
        exclusion principle</b></i> and <i><b>punctuated equilibrium.</b></i> 
        The former states that the only one species can win in one niche, and 
        the latter is the observations of step-like evolution; evolution occurs 
        discontinuously and there are equilibria between them. More interestingly, 
        the theory predicts that increasing mutation rate decelerates and eventually 
        stops evolution. As mutation is considered to be engine of evolution, 
        this is apparently counterintuitive. However, this negative effect is 
        actually observed in laboratory experiments.</p>
